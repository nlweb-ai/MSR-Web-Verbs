I want to search for the latest news about healthy eating, then find the top 3 most popular Spotify tracks about healthy food. For each track, I want to search for books about nutrition in OpenLibrary. For the first book found for each track, I want to check if there are any apartments for rent in San Diego, CA, under $2600, within 2 miles of a major grocery store.
