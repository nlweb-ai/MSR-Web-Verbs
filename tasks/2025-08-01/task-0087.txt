I'm researching investment opportunities in Seattle's real estate market on August 22, 2025. First, I'll search for rental properties in Seattle between $2500-$4000 using Redfin to understand the current market. Based on the number of available properties, I'll calculate the average price per property type. Then I'll find real estate and investment companies near downtown Seattle using Google Maps to schedule consultations. Next, I'll search for recent news about Seattle real estate market trends to make informed investment decisions. Finally, I'll look up books about real estate investing in OpenLibrary to educate myself further on investment strategies.
