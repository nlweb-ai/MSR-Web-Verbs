Task Description:
I am planning a professional networking event in San Diego on August 30, 2025. I will use Google Maps to find hotel conference facilities in San Diego. Then, I will use Redfin to search for short-term rentals for 8 out-of-town guests. Next, I will use Costco to find catering packages for 40 attendees. Finally, I will use Alaska Airlines to check flight prices from Phoenix to San Diego. I will compare hotel amenities and catering costs, and select the best rental based on proximity to the hotel.
