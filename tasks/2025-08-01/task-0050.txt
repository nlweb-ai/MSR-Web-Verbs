I'm planning a professional development retreat for remote workers in Asheville, North Carolina on August 26-27, 2025, and need to arrange accommodation, find productivity tools, research skill-building resources, and plan team activities in the mountains. I want to create an inspiring environment for career growth and team bonding.

I'll search for hotels and mountain lodges in Asheville, North Carolina for August 26-27, 2025, focusing on properties that offer conference facilities, reliable WiFi, and scenic mountain views that will inspire creativity and provide a refreshing change from typical office environments for our team of 15 remote professionals. Based on accommodation options and amenities, I'll compare different retreat packages and calculate per-person costs including meeting spaces and meal options. Next, I'll search for office supplies and productivity tools at Costco to create welcome packages for retreat participants, including notebooks, planning tools, ergonomic accessories, and tech gadgets that will help remote workers improve their home office setups after returning from the retreat. I'll find outdoor activity centers and team-building venues near Asheville using Google Maps to plan hiking excursions, adventure courses, and group activities that will strengthen team relationships and provide stress relief from intensive professional development sessions. Finally, I'll search YouTube for "remote work productivity techniques" to curate expert presentations and workshop materials covering topics like time management, virtual collaboration, work-life balance, and career advancement strategies specifically designed for distributed teams.
