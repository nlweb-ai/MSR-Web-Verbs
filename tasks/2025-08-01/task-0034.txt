Task Description:
I want to prepare a tech news digest for my team in New York on August 5, 2025. First, I will use News to search for the latest technology news articles from the past week. Then, I will use Wikimedia to find background information on any trending tech topics. Next, I will use teams_microsoft_com to send a summary message to my team's group chat. Finally, I will use OpenWeather to check the weather forecast for New York on August 5, 2025, to include a weather update in the message. I will compile the news, background info, and weather into a concise update for the team.
