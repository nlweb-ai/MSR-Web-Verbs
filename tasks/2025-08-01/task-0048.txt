I'm starting an urban farming initiative in Detroit, Michigan on August 16, 2025, and need to source gardening supplies, find suitable vacant lots, research sustainable agriculture practices, and understand local weather patterns for crop planning. I want to create a community-based food production system that addresses local food security.

I'll clear my Amazon cart to start fresh with urban farming purchases and then add high-quality seeds, soil amendments, and specialized urban gardening tools that are specifically designed for small-space agriculture and container gardening in urban environments. Based on the cart contents and pricing, I'll calculate startup costs per plot and determine bulk purchasing opportunities for community members who want to participate in the initiative. Next, I'll search for vacant lots and community garden spaces near downtown Detroit to identify suitable locations for our urban farming project, focusing on areas with good soil conditions, adequate sunlight, and community accessibility for neighborhood involvement. I'll search YouTube for "urban farming techniques container gardening" to develop comprehensive training materials for community volunteers, covering topics like soil preparation, companion planting, pest management, and harvest optimization in city environments. Finally, I'll check the current weather conditions in Detroit, Michigan to understand local growing conditions and plan our planting schedule for late summer crops that can be harvested before the first frost, ensuring maximum food production for the community.
