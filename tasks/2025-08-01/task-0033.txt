Task Description:
I want to plan a music-themed walking tour in Nashville on August 9, 2025. First, I will use Spotify to search for top country music playlists. Then, I will use maps_google_com to find famous music venues and museums in Nashville. Next, I will use News to find recent articles about country music events in the city. Finally, I will use OpenWeather to check the weather forecast for Nashville on August 9, 2025, to prepare for the tour. I will create a route that visits the top venues, includes music recommendations, and provides weather tips for participants.
