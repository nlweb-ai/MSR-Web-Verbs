I need to prepare for a professional development workshop in Atlanta, Georgia on August 19, 2025. First, I'll search for office supplies and presentation materials at Costco to equip our workshop space. Based on available supplies and prices, I'll calculate the cost per workshop participant (expecting 25 attendees). Then I'll look for meeting rooms and conference centers near Atlanta airport using Google Maps for easy access for out-of-town attendees. Next, I'll search for business and professional development books in OpenLibrary to create a recommended reading list for participants. Finally, I'll find recent news about professional development trends to incorporate current best practices into our workshop curriculum.
