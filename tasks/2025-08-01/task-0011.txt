I'm planning a weekend getaway to Portland, Oregon and need to organize my travel preparations. I want to book accommodation, check the weather forecast, find good restaurants, and clear my shopping cart for travel essentials.

I'll start by searching for hotels in Portland, Oregon for my stay from August 15th to August 17th. Based on the hotel prices, I'll calculate my accommodation budget and determine how much I can spend on other activities. Next, I'll check the current weather in Portland to decide what clothes to pack. I'll find restaurants and cafes near downtown Portland to plan my dining experiences. Finally, I'll clear my Amazon cart to make room for travel-specific items I might need to purchase.
