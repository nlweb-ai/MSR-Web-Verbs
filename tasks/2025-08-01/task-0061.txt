I want to compare the prices of air purifiers at Costco and then find apartments for rent in Seattle, WA, under $2500. For the top 3 apartments, I want to check if any of the apartment addresses are within 2 miles of a Costco warehouse. If so, I want to get the most recent news headline about air quality in Seattle. The date for the apartment search should be today (August 5, 2025).
