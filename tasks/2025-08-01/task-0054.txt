I'm preparing a back-to-school shopping guide for parents in Dallas, Texas for the new school year starting August 19, 2025. I want to recommend affordable school supplies, check the weather for the first week of school, find the nearest Costco warehouse, and suggest educational YouTube videos for students.

First, I'll use Costco to search for school supplies like backpacks, notebooks, and lunch boxes, and calculate the total cost for a typical shopping list. Next, I'll use OpenWeather to get the weather forecast for Dallas for August 19-23, 2025, to help parents plan for the week. Then, I'll use Costco to set the preferred warehouse to the closest Dallas location. Finally, I'll use YouTube to search for "back to school tips for students" and select 3 helpful videos to recommend.
