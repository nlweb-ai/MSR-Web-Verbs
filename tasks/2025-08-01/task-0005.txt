I'm a student working on a research project about space exploration. I need to gather information from multiple sources and check travel details for a potential NASA facility visit on August 5-8, 2025.

I'll search for recent space exploration news to get current developments. Then I'll search for educational videos about space missions to enhance my understanding. I need to get weather forecast data for Houston where NASA Johnson Space Center is located. Finally, I'll search for flights from LAX to Houston for a potential field trip on August 5-8, 2025.
