I'm planning a sustainable living workshop in Portland, Oregon on August 15, 2025, and need to research eco-friendly products, find educational content, gather environmental news, and check weather conditions for outdoor activities. I want to promote environmental awareness through practical demonstrations and expert insights.

I'll search YouTube for "sustainable living tips zero waste" to compile comprehensive educational materials and create a resource library for workshop participants covering topics like waste reduction, energy conservation, and sustainable shopping habits. Based on video content and length, I'll organize a structured learning curriculum with different modules for beginners and advanced participants. Next, I'll search for eco-friendly household products and organic foods at Costco to demonstrate sustainable shopping practices and provide participants with hands-on experience in selecting environmentally responsible products. I'll gather recent environmental and climate change news to discuss current sustainability challenges and success stories, helping participants understand the broader context of their individual actions. Finally, I'll check the current weather conditions in Portland, Oregon to plan our outdoor composting demonstration and urban gardening activities, ensuring we have appropriate backup indoor alternatives if needed.
