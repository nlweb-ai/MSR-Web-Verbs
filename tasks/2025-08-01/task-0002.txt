I'm moving to a new city and need to set up my shopping routine. I want to find an apartment in Bellevue, WA, locate nearby Costco warehouse, shop for groceries, and add items to my Amazon cart for home essentials.

I'll start by searching for apartments in Bellevue, WA within my budget range of $2500-$3500. Then I'll set my preferred Costco warehouse location to be close to my new home. I need to search for organic food options at Costco for healthy eating. Finally, I'll add a coffee maker to my Amazon cart since I'll need one for my new place.
