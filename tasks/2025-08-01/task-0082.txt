I want to prepare for a home cooking project focused on space-themed recipes for August 12, 2025. First, I'll get NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day for inspiration about space themes. Based on the image and description, I'll determine if it's related to planets, stars, or galaxies. Then I'll search Amazon for kitchen supplies related to my theme (like star-shaped cookie cutters or planet-themed baking molds). Next, I'll look up cooking and baking books in OpenLibrary related to my space theme. Finally, I'll search for the top 3 Spotify playlists about cooking or baking to create the perfect ambiance while I work on my space-themed recipes.
