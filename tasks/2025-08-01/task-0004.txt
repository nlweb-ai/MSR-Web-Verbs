I'm organizing a birthday party for August 15, 2025 and need to handle all the logistics. I want to clear my Amazon cart first, then shop for party supplies at Costco, find nearby restaurants, and book a hotel for out-of-town guests arriving August 14-16, 2025.

I'll start by clearing my Amazon cart to remove old items. Then I'll search for party supplies at Costco to get everything in bulk. I need to find good restaurants near the party venue in downtown Portland for catering options. Finally, I'll search for hotels for my relatives coming from out of state for August 14-16, 2025.
