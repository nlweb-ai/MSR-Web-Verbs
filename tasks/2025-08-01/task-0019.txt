I'm launching a fitness coaching business in Atlanta, Georgia and need to research the market, gather educational content, analyze weather patterns for outdoor activities, and find office space. I want to clear my cart, search for fitness videos, check local weather, and find commercial properties.

I'll clear my Amazon cart to start fresh with fitness equipment and business supplies I need for my new coaching venture. After clearing the cart, I'll research what essential items I need and create a priority list based on my startup budget. Next, I'll search YouTube for "personal training techniques" to build a comprehensive video library for client education and my own professional development. I'll check the current weather in Atlanta, Georgia to understand seasonal patterns that will affect outdoor training sessions and client scheduling. Finally, I'll find gyms and fitness centers near downtown Atlanta to research the competition and identify potential partnership opportunities.
