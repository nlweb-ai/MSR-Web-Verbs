I want to search for the latest news about electric vehicles in California, then find the top 3 most popular Spotify tracks about electric cars. For each track, I want to search for books about electric vehicles in OpenLibrary. For the first book found for each track, I want to check if there are any apartments for rent in Los Angeles, CA, under $3500, available within the next 30 days, that are within 2 miles of a public charging station.
