Task Description:
I am planning a corporate training session in Houston on August 12, 2025. I will use Redfin to find a rental property for 10 attendees. Then, I will use Costco to search for lunch catering options. Next, I will use Alaska Airlines to check flight prices from Miami to Houston. Finally, I will use Google Maps to find training centers near the rental property. I will compare catering costs and training center amenities, and select the best flight options for the group.
