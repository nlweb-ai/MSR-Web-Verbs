I'm planning a culinary tourism experience in New Orleans, Louisiana for August 18-21, 2025, and need to arrange accommodation, research local cuisine, find authentic restaurants, and check travel logistics from Chicago. I want to create an immersive food and culture experience that showcases the best of New Orleans gastronomy.

I'll search for flights from Chicago O'Hare to New Orleans for August 18-21, 2025, to secure convenient travel dates that maximize our time in the city while finding the best fare options for our culinary adventure. Based on flight schedules and prices, I'll calculate the optimal departure and return times that allow for maximum food exploration opportunities. Next, I'll search for hotels in the French Quarter area for our stay from August 18-21, 2025, focusing on properties within walking distance of renowned restaurants and food markets to minimize transportation needs and maximize authentic local experiences. I'll use Google Maps to find the best route from Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport to French Quarter hotels, including stops at famous food markets like the French Market for an immediate introduction to local flavors. Finally, I'll locate authentic Creole and Cajun restaurants near the French Quarter, researching highly-rated establishments that offer traditional dishes like gumbo, jambalaya, beignets, and po'boys to create a comprehensive dining itinerary for our group.
