I'm organizing a tech startup event in San Francisco and need to handle procurement, accommodation, news research, and travel arrangements. I want to buy supplies from Costco, find hotels for attendees, stay updated on tech news, and get direction information for the venue.

I'll set my preferred Costco warehouse to San Francisco, CA to ensure local inventory availability for bulk purchases. Then I'll search for office supplies and snacks at Costco to calculate catering and material costs for 50 attendees. Next, I'll search for hotels in San Francisco for August 25th to August 27th to provide accommodation options for out-of-town speakers. I'll search for the latest technology news to identify trending topics we should discuss at the event. Finally, I'll get directions from San Francisco International Airport to downtown San Francisco to provide travel guidance for attendees.
