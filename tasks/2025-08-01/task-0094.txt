I need to plan a educational field trip for students to Washington D.C. on August 26, 2025. First, I'll search for flights from Boston to Washington D.C. for that date using Alaska Airlines to estimate transportation costs for 30 students and 3 teachers. Then I'll look for group accommodations or hostels in Washington D.C. for August 26-27, 2025. Based on flight and hotel costs, I'll calculate the total cost per student. Next, I'll find museums and educational attractions near the National Mall using Google Maps to plan our educational itinerary. Finally, I'll get NASA's Near Earth Objects data to incorporate real space science into our museum visits and make the trip more engaging for students.
