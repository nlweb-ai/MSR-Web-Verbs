I'm planning a business trip to Chicago, Illinois and need to organize travel logistics, accommodation, shopping, and stay informed about current events. I want to book flights, find hotels, add items to my cart, and catch up on business news.

I'll search for flights from Los Angeles, CA to Chicago, IL for August 12th to August 15th to plan my business trip. Based on flight times and prices, I'll calculate the total travel cost and adjust my budget accordingly. Next, I'll search for hotels in Chicago for the same dates to find suitable business accommodations near the downtown area. I'll add a business laptop bag to my Amazon cart since I need reliable travel gear for carrying important documents and electronics. Finally, I'll search for current business news to stay updated on market trends and topics I might discuss during my meetings.
