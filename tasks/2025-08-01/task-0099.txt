I want to plan a art therapy workshop for seniors in Tampa, Florida on August 14, 2025. First, I'll search for art supplies and craft materials at Costco to stock our workshop with brushes, paints, and canvases. Based on supply costs, I'll calculate the materials budget for 20 senior participants. Then I'll add additional therapeutic art supplies like colored pencils and sketchbooks to my Amazon cart. Next, I'll find senior centers and community arts facilities near downtown Tampa using Google Maps (up to 10 locations) to secure an accessible venue for our workshop. Finally, I'll search for art therapy and creative aging books in OpenLibrary to design evidence-based activities that promote mental wellness and artistic expression for older adults.
