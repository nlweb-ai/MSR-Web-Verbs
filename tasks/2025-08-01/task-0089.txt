I'm organizing a music festival planning committee in Nashville, Tennessee for August 28, 2025. First, I'll search Spotify for the top 6 country music tracks to understand current trends and popular artists for our festival lineup. Based on the popularity scores, I'll calculate which genres are trending highest. Then I'll search for event planning supplies and audio equipment at Costco for our festival infrastructure. Next, I'll find event venues and concert halls near downtown Nashville using Google Maps (up to 10 locations) to secure our festival location. Finally, I'll get recent news about music festivals and live events to stay updated on industry best practices and safety requirements.
