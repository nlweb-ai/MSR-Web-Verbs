I'm planning a weekend hiking trip to Boulder, Colorado on August 16-17, 2025, and want to check the weather, find the best hiking trails, locate nearby outdoor gear stores, and read recent news about trail conditions.

First, I'll use OpenWeather to get the weather forecast for Boulder for August 16-17, 2025, to prepare for the trip. Next, I'll use Google Maps to find the 5 nearest hiking trails to my hotel. Then, I'll use Google Maps to find the 3 closest outdoor gear stores to the trailhead. Finally, I'll use News to search for recent articles about Boulder hiking trail conditions to check for closures or hazards.
