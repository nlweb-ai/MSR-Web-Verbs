I'm organizing a tech startup investor meetup in San Francisco on August 20, 2025, and need to coordinate venue logistics, catering, accommodation for out-of-town investors, and local transportation. I want to ensure professional presentation setup, quality food options, convenient lodging, and efficient travel routes.

I'll search for professional presentation equipment and tech accessories at Costco to create an impressive demo environment for startup pitches. Based on equipment availability and pricing, I'll calculate different setup tiers (basic, premium, executive) and determine the optimal package for our 50-person event. Next, I'll search for hotels in downtown San Francisco for August 19-21, 2025, to accommodate investors traveling from other cities, focusing on business-class properties near the financial district. I'll use Google Maps to find the optimal route from San Francisco International Airport to downtown hotels, calculating travel time and distance to help investors plan their arrival schedules. Finally, I'll search for nearby upscale restaurants and catering services around Union Square to arrange high-quality dining options that will impress potential investors and facilitate networking conversations.
