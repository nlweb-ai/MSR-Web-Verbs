I'm organizing a senior citizens' technology workshop in Phoenix, Arizona on August 12, 2025, and need to find appropriate devices, create educational content, locate accessible venues, and plan for weather considerations. I want to help seniors become more comfortable with modern technology through patient, hands-on instruction.

I'll search for beginner-friendly technology devices and accessories at Costco, including tablets, smartphones, smart home devices, and assistive technology tools that are particularly suitable for senior users with considerations for larger screens, simplified interfaces, and accessibility features. Based on device availability and pricing, I'll create different technology starter packages (basic communication, home automation, entertainment) tailored to various comfort levels and budgets. Next, I'll search YouTube for "technology tutorials for seniors" to compile age-appropriate educational materials that explain concepts slowly and clearly, covering topics like email, video calling, online banking, social media safety, and basic troubleshooting techniques. I'll check the current weather conditions in Phoenix, Arizona to ensure our indoor workshop space has adequate air conditioning and to plan for any outdoor demonstration activities involving smart garden devices or home security systems. Finally, I'll find senior centers and community facilities near Phoenix that are wheelchair accessible and equipped with proper lighting and seating for comfortable learning environments for our expected 30 participants aged 65 and older.
