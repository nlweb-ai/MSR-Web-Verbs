I'm researching investment opportunities in Phoenix, Arizona and need to analyze the local real estate market, space industry developments, weather patterns, and transportation infrastructure. I want to find rental properties, get space news, check climate data, and research local businesses.

I'll search for apartments in Phoenix, Arizona with rent between $1500 and $2500 to analyze the local rental market trends. Based on the rental prices and locations, I'll calculate the average cost per square foot and identify the most promising neighborhoods for investment. Next, I'll get NASA's Near Earth Object data for August 8th, 2025 to stay informed about space industry activities since Phoenix has a growing aerospace sector. I'll check the current weather in Phoenix to understand the climate conditions that affect property maintenance costs and resident preferences. Finally, I'll find technology companies near downtown Phoenix to assess the local job market and economic growth potential.
