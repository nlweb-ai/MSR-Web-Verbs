I want to plan a culinary adventure weekend in New Orleans, Louisiana for August 23-24, 2025. First, I'll search for hotels in New Orleans for my stay dates to establish my accommodation base. Then I'll find the best restaurants and cafes near the French Quarter using Google Maps (maximum 12 locations) to create my dining itinerary. Based on the restaurant options, I'll prioritize seafood and Creole cuisine establishments. Next, I'll search Amazon for a high-quality camera to document my food experiences and create a culinary blog. Finally, I'll look up cookbooks about Louisiana and Creole cuisine in OpenLibrary to learn about the cultural background of the dishes I'll be trying.
