I want to organize a charity fundraising event in Chicago, Illinois on August 21, 2025. First, I'll check the weather forecast for Chicago to plan whether our event should be indoors or outdoors. If it's going to be clear with temperatures above 70Â°F, I'll plan an outdoor event. Then I'll search for event supplies and fundraising materials at Costco within my $800 budget. Next, I'll find community centers and event halls near downtown Chicago using Google Maps (up to 6 venues) as backup indoor options. Finally, I'll search Spotify for uplifting and inspirational music (top 4 tracks) to create a positive atmosphere during our charity event.
