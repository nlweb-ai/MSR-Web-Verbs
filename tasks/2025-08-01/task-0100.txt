I'm planning a cultural exchange program in Los Angeles, California for August 10, 2025. First, I'll search for flights from New York to Los Angeles for that date using Alaska Airlines to calculate travel costs for 8 international students. Then I'll look for group accommodations or student housing in Los Angeles for August 10-17, 2025. Based on travel and accommodation costs, I'll determine the program fee per student. Next, I'll find cultural centers and museums near Hollywood using Google Maps (maximum 12 locations) to create an educational itinerary showcasing American culture. Finally, I'll search for cross-cultural communication and American culture books in OpenLibrary to prepare orientation materials for our international participants.
