I'm organizing a film festival screening in Portland, Oregon on August 31, 2025. First, I'll search for audio-visual equipment and projectors at Costco to set up professional screening rooms. Based on equipment availability and prices, I'll determine how many screening rooms I can afford with my $2000 budget. Then I'll find movie theaters and event venues near downtown Portland using Google Maps to secure our festival location. Next, I'll search Amazon for film festival promotional materials like posters and programs. Finally, I'll get recent news about independent film festivals to understand current trends and best practices for promoting emerging filmmakers.
