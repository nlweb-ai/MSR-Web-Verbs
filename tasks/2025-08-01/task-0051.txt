I'm moving to Seattle, Washington and want to find a new apartment to rent, check the weather forecast for my move-in week, research the best local coffee shops, and create a reading list about Seattle's history. My move-in date is August 18, 2025.

First, I'll search Redfin for apartments for rent in Seattle, WA with a budget between $1800 and $2500. I'll select the top 3 apartments based on price and proximity to downtown. Next, I'll use OpenWeather to get the 7-day weather forecast for Seattle starting August 18, 2025, so I can plan my move and packing list. Then, I'll use Google Maps to find the 5 nearest coffee shops to the apartment I like best, and calculate the average walking distance from that apartment to each coffee shop. Finally, I'll use OpenLibrary to search for books about Seattle's history, and create a reading list of 5 books to help me learn more about my new city.
