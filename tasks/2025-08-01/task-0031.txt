Task Description:
I want to host a book club meeting in Seattle on August 10, 2025. First, I will use OpenLibrary to search for books by Agatha Christie and select one for the meeting. Then, I will use News to find recent news articles about Agatha Christie or her works. Next, I will use Spotify to find a playlist or album inspired by Agatha Christie novels to play during the meeting. Finally, I will use Wikimedia to find interesting facts about Agatha Christie's life to share with attendees. I will summarize the book options, news highlights, music, and facts for the group, and create a recommended reading and listening list.
