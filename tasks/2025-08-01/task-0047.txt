I'm planning a family reunion outdoor adventure in Yellowstone National Park for August 28-30, 2025, and need to coordinate camping supplies, weather preparations, accommodation logistics, and educational activities for multiple generations. I want to create memorable experiences while ensuring everyone's comfort and safety.

I'll search for camping and outdoor equipment at Costco to outfit our extended family group of 20 people with tents, sleeping bags, portable grills, coolers, hiking gear, and family-friendly outdoor games suitable for ages 8 to 75, comparing bulk pricing options and quality ratings for different product categories. Based on equipment costs and family size, I'll calculate shared purchase arrangements and determine individual family responsibilities for gear procurement. Next, I'll check the current weather conditions for Yellowstone National Park area to plan appropriate clothing recommendations, activity scheduling, and backup indoor plans, ensuring we're prepared for mountain weather variations and potential afternoon thunderstorms. I'll search for hotels and lodges near Yellowstone National Park for August 28-30, 2025, to provide comfortable accommodation options for family members who prefer not to camp, focusing on properties that offer family rooms and are within reasonable driving distance of park entrances. Finally, I'll search YouTube for "Yellowstone family activities wildlife viewing" to create an educational program about park wildlife, geological features, and safety guidelines that will enhance our outdoor experience and keep children engaged while learning about nature conservation.
