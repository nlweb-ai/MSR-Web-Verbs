Task Description:
I want to host a science outreach event in Portland on August 28, 2025. First, I will use Google Maps to find community centers in Portland. Then, I will use Redfin to search for short-term rentals for 4 guest speakers. Next, I will use Costco to find science kits for hands-on activities. Finally, I will use Alaska Airlines to check flight options for speakers coming from Seattle. I will compare science kit prices and venue amenities, and select the best rental based on location.
