I'm planning a fitness and wellness day in Austin, Texas on August 25, 2025. First, I'll search for gym equipment and protein supplements at Costco to calculate my fitness budget. Based on the prices, I'll determine how much I can spend on other wellness activities. Then I'll use Google Maps to find yoga studios and fitness centers near downtown Austin (maximum 6 locations). Next, I'll search for apartments for rent in Austin between $1200-$2000 to consider relocating closer to my favorite fitness spots. Finally, I'll get recent news about fitness trends and wellness tips to stay updated on the latest health information.
