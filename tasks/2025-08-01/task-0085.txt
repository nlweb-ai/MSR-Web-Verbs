I want to plan a science fiction book club meeting in Denver, Colorado for August 18, 2025. First, I'll search OpenLibrary for science fiction books published in the last 2 years to create our reading list. Based on the number of books found, I'll calculate how many meetings we need to cover them all (assuming 1 book per meeting). Then I'll search for meeting supplies and snacks at Costco for our book club gatherings. Next, I'll find the top 4 sci-fi themed tracks on Spotify to create ambient background music for our discussions. Finally, I'll get NASA's Near Earth Objects data to share fascinating real space facts during our sci-fi discussions.
