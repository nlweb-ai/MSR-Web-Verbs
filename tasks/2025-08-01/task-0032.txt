Task Description:
I want to organize a science outreach event for kids in San Francisco on August 15, 2025. First, I will use Nasa to get the Astronomy Picture of the Day for that date and print it for the event. Then, I will use OpenWeather to check the weather forecast for San Francisco on August 15, 2025, to plan for outdoor activities. Next, I will use News to find recent science news articles suitable for children. Finally, I will use Wikimedia to find fun facts about the solar system to share during the event. I will summarize the picture, weather, news, and facts for the event handout.
