I want to plan a astronomy-themed birthday party for my child in Phoenix, Arizona on August 16, 2025. First, I'll get NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day to use as inspiration for party decorations and activities. Based on whether it shows planets, stars, or galaxies, I'll choose a specific space theme. Then I'll search Costco for party supplies, telescopes, or space-themed toys within my $300 budget. Next, I'll add space-themed birthday cake decorations to my Amazon cart. Finally, I'll search for children's books about space and astronomy in OpenLibrary to create educational party favors and a space-themed reading corner.
