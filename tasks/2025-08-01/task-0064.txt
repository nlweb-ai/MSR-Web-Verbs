I want to find the top 2 most popular Spotify albums released in the last 2 years with the genre "jazz". For each album, I want to search for books about jazz music in OpenLibrary. For the first book found for each album, I want to check if there are any apartments for rent in New Orleans, LA, under $2000, within 3 miles of a jazz club. For each matching apartment, I want to get the weather forecast for the move-in date, which is August 15, 2025.
