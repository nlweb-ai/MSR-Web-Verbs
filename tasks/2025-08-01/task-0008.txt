I'm planning a business trip to Chicago for August 12-15, 2025 and need to coordinate travel, accommodation, shopping, and stay updated on current events.

I'll search for flights from Phoenix to Chicago for my business meetings on August 12-15, 2025. Then I'll book a hotel near the business district for convenience during August 12-15, 2025. I need to add a professional leather briefcase to my Amazon cart for the important presentations. Finally, I'll check the latest business news to stay informed about market trends during my trip.
