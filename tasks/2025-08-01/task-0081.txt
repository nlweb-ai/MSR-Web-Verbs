I want to plan a weekend getaway to Portland, Oregon for August 15-17, 2025. First, I need to search for flights from LAX to PDX for those dates using Alaska Airlines. Based on the flight prices, I'll calculate my remaining budget (starting with $2000). Then I'll search for hotels in Portland during my stay using Booking.com. After securing accommodation, I want to find nearby coffee shops around my hotel area using Google Maps (maximum 5 locations). Finally, I'll get the current news about Portland tourism to stay informed about local events and attractions during my visit.
