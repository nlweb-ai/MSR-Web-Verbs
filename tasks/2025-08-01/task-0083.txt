I need to organize a romantic dinner in San Francisco for August 20, 2025. First, I'll check the weather forecast for San Francisco to plan whether we'll dine indoors or outdoors. If the temperature is above 65Â°F and no rain is predicted, I'll search for outdoor dining restaurants near Golden Gate Park using Google Maps (up to 8 restaurants). Then I'll search Costco for romantic dinner supplies like candles, flowers, or wine. Finally, I'll create the perfect romantic playlist by searching Spotify for the top 5 love songs to set the mood for our special evening.
