I'm planning a family vacation to Orlando, Florida for August 10-17, 2025. I need to book flights, find accommodation, check the weather forecast, and search for nearby entertainment options.

First, I'll search for flights from Seattle to Orlando for August 10-17, 2025. Then I'll look for hotels in Orlando during our stay from August 10-17, 2025. I want to check the weather forecast to know what to expect during our trip. Finally, I'll find nearby theme parks and attractions around our hotel area.
