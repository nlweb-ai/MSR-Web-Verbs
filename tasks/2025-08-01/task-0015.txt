I'm preparing for a photography workshop in Miami, Florida and need to handle equipment shopping, weather planning, venue research, and educational content gathering. I want to buy camera gear, check weather conditions, find photography locations, and research tutorial videos.

I'll search for camera equipment at Costco to find affordable photography gear for workshop participants. Based on the available equipment and prices, I'll calculate a budget breakdown for different participant packages (basic, intermediate, advanced). Next, I'll check the current weather in Miami, Florida to plan our outdoor shooting sessions and determine backup indoor locations. I'll find parks and scenic locations near Miami Beach for our photography practice sessions. Finally, I'll search YouTube for "photography lighting techniques" to create a comprehensive learning resource for workshop attendees.
