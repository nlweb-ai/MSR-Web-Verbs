I'm planning a weekend getaway to San Diego, California from August 15-17, 2025, and want to find affordable flights, check the weather for my travel dates, discover top-rated seafood restaurants, and create a playlist for my trip. 

First, I'll use Alaska Airlines to search for round-trip flights from Seattle (SEA) to San Diego (SAN) departing August 15 and returning August 17, 2025, and pick the best option based on price and schedule. Next, I'll use OpenWeather to get the weather forecast for San Diego for those dates to help me pack appropriately. Then, I'll use Google Maps to find the 5 best-rated seafood restaurants near my hotel, and sort them by distance. Finally, I'll use Spotify to search for and select 10 songs with a "beach" or "summer" theme to create a travel playlist for my trip.
