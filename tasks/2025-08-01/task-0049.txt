I'm organizing a vintage car show fundraiser in Nashville, Tennessee on August 24, 2025, and need to coordinate venue logistics, find automotive supplies, research classic car maintenance resources, and plan for weather contingencies. I want to create an engaging event that celebrates automotive history while raising money for local charities.

I'll search for automotive care products and display supplies at Costco to help car show participants prepare their vehicles for exhibition, including car wax, detailing products, portable display stands, and event setup materials like tents and tables for vendor booths. Based on product availability and bulk pricing, I'll create care packages for participants and calculate fundraising profit margins from vendor booth sales. Next, I'll search for event venues and open spaces near downtown Nashville that can accommodate approximately 100 vintage cars plus spectator areas, focusing on locations with adequate parking, electrical access for sound systems, and good visibility from main roads to attract walk-in visitors. I'll search YouTube for "classic car restoration maintenance tips" to create educational content for our event program, featuring expert advice that attendees can use to maintain their vintage vehicles and appreciate the craftsmanship of the displayed automobiles. Finally, I'll check the current weather conditions in Nashville, Tennessee to prepare for potential rain or extreme heat that could affect outdoor displays, ensuring we have appropriate tent rental plans and indoor backup options for valuable or weather-sensitive classic cars.
