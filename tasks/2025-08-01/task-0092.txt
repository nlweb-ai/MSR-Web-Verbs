I'm preparing for a technology startup pitch event in San Jose, California on August 27, 2025. First, I'll search for presentation equipment and tech gadgets at Costco to prepare professional demo setups. Based on equipment costs, I'll allocate my $1500 tech budget across different presentation needs. Then I'll find co-working spaces and startup incubators near Silicon Valley using Google Maps to network and possibly relocate my startup. Next, I'll get recent news about technology startups and venture capital to understand current market trends and investor interests. Finally, I'll search for entrepreneurship and startup books in OpenLibrary to refine my business strategy and pitch techniques.
