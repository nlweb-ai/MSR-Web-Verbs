I'm helping my elderly parents with their daily needs in Tampa, Florida. I want to find them a senior-friendly apartment, locate nearby healthcare facilities, ensure they have emergency supplies, and check local news for community updates.

I'll search for apartments in Tampa, FL in a senior-friendly area with reasonable rent between $1200-$1800 for their budget. Then I'll find nearby medical centers and pharmacies for their healthcare needs. I need to search for emergency supplies at Costco to help them prepare for any situations. Finally, I'll check local Tampa Florida news to keep them informed about their community.
