I'm planning a science-themed summer camp for kids in Chicago, Illinois from August 12-16, 2025, and want to find educational books, check the weather for outdoor experiments, locate science museums, and gather recent science news for daily discussions.

First, I'll use OpenLibrary to search for children's science books and select 5 for our camp library. Next, I'll use OpenWeather to get the weather forecast for Chicago for August 12-16, 2025, to plan outdoor activities. Then, I'll use Google Maps to find the 3 nearest science museums to our camp location. Finally, I'll use News to search for recent science news articles to share with campers each day.
