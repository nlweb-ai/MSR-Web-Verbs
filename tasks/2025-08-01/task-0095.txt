I want to plan a wellness retreat in Sedona, Arizona for August 29, 2025. First, I'll search for spa and wellness hotels in Sedona for that date to establish my retreat location. Then I'll search for yoga and meditation supplies at Costco to create personalized wellness kits for retreat participants. Based on supply costs, I'll calculate pricing for 15 retreat participants. Next, I'll find hiking trails and wellness centers near Sedona using Google Maps (maximum 10 locations) to plan outdoor meditation and nature therapy sessions. Finally, I'll search for meditation and mindfulness books in OpenLibrary to create a curated reading list for retreat participants to continue their wellness journey at home.
