I'm organizing a music-themed birthday party in Nashville, Tennessee on August 23, 2025, and want to create a custom playlist, check the weather for the party date, find a local bakery for the cake, and research the history of country music for trivia games.

First, I'll use Spotify to search for 20 popular country music tracks to build a playlist. Next, I'll use OpenWeather to get the weather forecast for Nashville on August 23, 2025, to plan for indoor or outdoor activities. Then, I'll use Google Maps to find the 3 best-rated bakeries near my party venue. Finally, I'll use OpenLibrary to search for books about the history of country music and select 3 for trivia inspiration.
