I'm organizing an astronomy enthusiast gathering in Denver, Colorado on August 22, 2025, and need to coordinate educational materials, space-themed content, equipment purchases, and local stargazing locations. I want to create an engaging experience that combines scientific learning with practical observation opportunities.

I'll get NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day for August 22, 2025, to feature as the centerpiece of our gathering and use it as discussion material about current astronomical discoveries and space exploration missions. Based on the image content and explanation, I'll prepare educational talking points and related questions for group discussion. Next, I'll search for telescopes and astronomy equipment at Costco to provide hands-on observation tools for participants, comparing different telescope types and calculating group purchase discounts for members who want to continue stargazing after the event. I'll search YouTube for "astronomy beginner telescope guide" to create a comprehensive learning resource for newcomers to stargazing, covering topics like constellation identification, telescope operation, and astrophotography basics. Finally, I'll find dark sky areas and observatories near Denver using Google Maps to identify the best stargazing locations with minimal light pollution, calculating drive times and accessibility for our group of 25 astronomy enthusiasts.
