I'm planning a weekend camping trip for August 2-4, 2025 and need to prepare thoroughly. I want to check weather conditions, buy camping gear, find directions to the campsite, and research outdoor activities through educational videos.

I'll check the current weather at Yellowstone National Park to know what conditions to expect for August 2-4, 2025. Then I'll search for camping gear at Costco to get quality equipment at good prices. I need directions from Salt Lake City to Yellowstone National Park where I'm camping. Finally, I'll watch videos about wilderness survival skills to be better prepared.
