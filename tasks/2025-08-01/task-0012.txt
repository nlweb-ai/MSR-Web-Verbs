I'm relocating to Austin, Texas for work and need to find suitable housing options within my budget. I want to research apartments, check weather patterns, find flights from my current location, and search for educational content about living in Texas.

I'll search for apartments in Austin, Texas with rent between $1800 and $2800 per month to find suitable options. Based on the apartment listings, I'll calculate the average rent and determine if I need to adjust my budget expectations. Next, I'll check the current weather in Austin to understand what climate I'll be moving to. I'll search for flights from Seattle, WA to Austin, TX for August 20th to August 22nd to plan my house-hunting trip. Finally, I'll search YouTube for videos about "moving to Austin Texas" to learn more about the city and get tips from locals.
