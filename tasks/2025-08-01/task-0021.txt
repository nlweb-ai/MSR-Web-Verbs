Task Description:
I want to plan a business trip to Seattle for a team of 5 from August 10 to August 13, 2025. First, I will use Redfin to find 3-bedroom rental properties available in Seattle for those dates. Next, I will use Alaska Airlines to search for round-trip flights from San Francisco to Seattle for the same dates. After that, I will use Costco to find bulk snack options for the team to bring on the trip. Finally, I will use Google Maps to locate coworking spaces near downtown Seattle. I will compare the total cost of flights and rental properties, and select the best coworking space based on proximity to the rental property.
