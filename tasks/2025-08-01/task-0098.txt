I need to organize a outdoor adventure club meetup in Denver, Colorado on August 17, 2025. First, I'll check the weather forecast for Denver to determine if conditions are suitable for outdoor activities. If the weather is clear with temperatures between 60-80Â°F, I'll proceed with outdoor planning. Then I'll search for camping and hiking gear at Costco to equip club members for our adventures. Next, I'll find outdoor gear stores and adventure tour companies near Denver using Google Maps (maximum 8 locations) to establish partnerships and equipment rentals. Finally, I'll search for outdoor adventure and hiking books in OpenLibrary to create a resource library for club members and plan future expeditions.
