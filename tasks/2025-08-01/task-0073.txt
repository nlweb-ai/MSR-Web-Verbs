I want to find the current weather in Miami, FL for August 15, 2025. If the temperature is above 90Â°F, I want to search for air conditioners at Costco and select the one with the highest price. Then, I want to find the top 3 Spotify tracks about summer and for each, search for books about heat in OpenLibrary, picking the book with the shortest title for each track.
