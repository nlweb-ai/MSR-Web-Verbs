Task Description:
I am planning a weekend art retreat in Santa Fe from August 16 to August 18, 2025. First, I will use Redfin to find a rental property with a large studio space for 6 artists. Next, I will use Costco to search for art supplies and snacks for the group. Then, I will use Alaska Airlines to check flight options for participants traveling from Denver to Santa Fe. Finally, I will use Google Maps to find local art galleries and museums near the rental property. I will compare rental amenities and art supply costs, and select the best gallery for a group visit based on proximity and reviews.
