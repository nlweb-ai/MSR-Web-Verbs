I'm organizing a family reunion in Nashville, Tennessee and need to coordinate travel, accommodation, entertainment, and catering arrangements. I want to find hotels, check travel directions, search for party supplies, and find local attractions.

I'll search for hotels in Nashville, Tennessee for August 18th to August 21st to accommodate my extended family members coming from different states. Based on hotel availability and pricing, I'll group family members by arrival dates and budget preferences to optimize room bookings. Next, I'll get directions from Nashville International Airport to downtown Nashville to provide clear travel instructions for flying relatives. I'll search for party supplies and decorations at Costco to plan our reunion celebration and calculate bulk purchase savings. Finally, I'll find museums and entertainment venues near downtown Nashville to create an itinerary of family-friendly activities for all ages.
