I'm starting a new fitness routine and need to organize my health and wellness plan in Austin, Texas. I want to clear old items from my cart, find workout equipment, locate nearby gyms, and learn about fitness through educational content.

I'll clear my Amazon cart to start fresh with health-focused purchases. Then I'll search for fitness equipment at Costco to set up a home gym. I need to find gyms and fitness centers near my location in Austin, TX for professional workouts. Finally, I'll search for fitness and nutrition videos to learn proper techniques and healthy eating habits.
