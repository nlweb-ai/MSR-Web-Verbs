I need to organize a family reunion in Miami, Florida on August 30, 2025. First, I'll search for flights from Chicago to Miami for that weekend using Alaska Airlines to estimate travel costs for family members. Then I'll look for large vacation rental properties or hotels in Miami that can accommodate 12 people for August 30-31, 2025. Based on accommodation options, I'll calculate the total cost per person. Next, I'll search Amazon for party supplies and decorations to make our reunion special. Finally, I'll check the current weather in Miami to plan appropriate outdoor activities and help family members pack accordingly.
