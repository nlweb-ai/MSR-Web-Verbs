I'm planning a space enthusiast meetup in Denver, Colorado and need to gather astronomical content and logistics information. I want to get NASA space content, check weather conditions, find nearby venues, and research space-related educational materials.

I'll start by getting NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day for August 10th, 2025 to use as featured content for the meetup. I'll analyze the image description to create engaging discussion topics about the celestial object or phenomenon shown. Next, I'll check the current weather in Denver, Colorado to determine if we can have any outdoor stargazing activities. I'll find conference centers and meeting spaces near downtown Denver to book a venue for our group. Finally, I'll search YouTube for "astronomy for beginners" videos to create a playlist for newcomers to our meetup.
