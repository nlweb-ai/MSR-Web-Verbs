I'm planning a scientific conference in Boston, Massachusetts and need to coordinate venue logistics, educational resources, space-themed content, and travel arrangements. I want to search for conference equipment, find educational videos, get astronomical content, and research local venues.

I'll search for presentation equipment and audio-visual supplies at Costco to set up a professional conference environment. Based on the available equipment and prices, I'll create different setup packages for various session types (keynote, breakout sessions, workshops). Next, I'll search YouTube for "scientific presentation skills" to create a resource guide for conference speakers and help them deliver more engaging talks. I'll get NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day for August 5th, 2025 to feature inspiring space content in our conference materials and opening ceremony. Finally, I'll find conference centers and meeting facilities near downtown Boston to secure an appropriate venue that can accommodate our expected 200 attendees.
