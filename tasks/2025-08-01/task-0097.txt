I want to start a mobile food truck business in Austin, Texas and need to research locations and supplies for August 24, 2025. First, I'll search for commercial kitchen equipment and food service supplies at Costco to estimate my startup costs. Based on equipment prices, I'll calculate my initial investment needs. Then I'll find food truck parking areas and busy commercial districts near downtown Austin using Google Maps (up to 15 locations) to identify the best spots for customer traffic. Next, I'll search for apartments in Austin between $1000-$1800 to find affordable housing near my target business areas. Finally, I'll look up food truck and restaurant business books in OpenLibrary to learn about regulations, permits, and successful business strategies.
