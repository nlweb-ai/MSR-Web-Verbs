I'm preparing for a job interview at a tech company in San Francisco on August 5, 2025. I need to check current tech news, get weather information for the interview day, find directions to the office, and research educational content about the company's technology stack.

I'll first check the latest technology news to stay informed about industry trends. Then I'll check the current weather in San Francisco to decide what to wear for the interview on August 5, 2025. I need directions from my hotel at Union Square to the Google headquarters. Finally, I'll search for educational videos about cloud computing since that's their main technology focus.
