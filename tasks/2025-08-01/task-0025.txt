Task Description:
I am planning a small research retreat in Denver from August 18 to August 20, 2025. I will use Redfin to find a rental cabin for 5 people. Then, I will use Costco to search for healthy breakfast options. Next, I will use Alaska Airlines to check flight prices from Dallas to Denver. Finally, I will use Google Maps to find hiking trails near the cabin. I will compare cabin amenities and hiking trail proximity, and select the best breakfast options for the group.
