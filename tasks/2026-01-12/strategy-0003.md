I'll read the file you've referenced to see what you need help with.
I'll create a clear, non-technical summary of what this function does.

# What This Function Does
## Overall Goal
This function helps someone plan a shopping trip to Costco in Anchorage, Alaska. Specifically, it finds winter jackets for children that are available at that store location.
## Main Steps (In Order)
1. **Sets the Store Location**
   - The function tells the Costco website to look at the Anchorage, Alaska store
   - This ensures you see products available at that specific location, not somewhere else
2. **Searches for Products**
   - It searches for "kids winter jackets" at the Anchorage Costco
   - This shows what children's winter coats are currently in stock
3. **Collects Product Information**
   - For each jacket found, it saves:
     - The product name (what the jacket is called)
     - The price (how much it costs)
     - Any problems that came up during the search
4. **Organizes Everything into a Report**
   - It creates a summary that includes:
     - Which store location was checked (Anchorage, AK)
     - What was searched for (kids winter jackets)
     - How many jackets were found
     - Details about each jacket (name and price)
     - Why this search was done (to help plan a trip to Anchorage in January 2026)
## What Data Is Being Collected
- **Store Information**: Confirmation that the Anchorage location was selected
- **Product List**: Names and prices of children's winter jackets available at that store
- **Shopping Context**: Notes explaining this is for a trip happening January 21-24, 2026
The end result is a organized list that helps someone know what winter jacket options are available for kids before they visit the Anchorage Costco.
