# What This Program Does - A Simple Explanation
## Overall Goal
This program helps someone plan a trip to Anchorage, Alaska by finding the **best hotel location** based on which one is closest to all the museums they want to visit.
## The Main Steps
1. **Lists the Options**
   - The program knows about 5 different hotels in Anchorage
   - It also knows about 4 museums the person wants to visit
2. **Measures All the Distances**
   - For each hotel, the program checks how far it is to every museum
   - It uses Google Maps to find out the distance and travel time from the hotel to each museum
   - This is like asking "How far is it from Hotel A to Museum 1? To Museum 2?" and so on
3. **Adds Up the Distances**
   - For each hotel, it adds together all the distances to the 4 museums
   - This gives a total number showing how much traveling you'd do from that hotel to see all the museums
4. **Finds the Winner**
   - The program picks the hotel with the **smallest total distance**
   - This is the hotel that makes it easiest to visit all the museums with the least amount of traveling
5. **Shares the Recommendation**
   - It tells you which hotel is best and why
   - It saves all the information so you can see the distances for each hotel if you want
## What Information Is Collected
- **Hotel names**: 5 different hotels in Anchorage
- **Museum names**: 4 museums to visit
- **Distances**: How far each hotel is from each museum
- **Travel times**: How long it takes to drive between each hotel and museum
- **Best choice**: Which hotel has the shortest total distance to all museums
- **Trip dates**: January 21-24, 2026 (for context about when the visit will happen)
## Why This Is Helpful
Instead of guessing which hotel would be most convenient, this program does the math to find the hotel that minimizes your driving around town, making your museum visits easier and less tiring.
