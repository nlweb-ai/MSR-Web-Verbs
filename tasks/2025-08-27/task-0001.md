## Task description 

My wife and I plan to fly to Anchorage on Tuesday of the next week, and come back to Seattle on Friday. In each full day there, we want to visit two museums. Please help us concretize this travel plan by finding a round trip flight and recommending good museums.

We need to find a hotel for all nights. Please suggest a list of options.

We would like to know the weather in Anchorage in the coming days, so that we can be better prepared. Also, please find a Youtube video for each of the museums.
