# Refinement Strategy for Anchorage Travel Task (Task-0001)

## Overview
This strategy document outlines the approach taken to refine the vague travel planning task into concrete, actionable steps with specific data collection.

## Original Task Analysis
The original task contained several areas needing concretization:
- **Vague dates**: "Tuesday of the next week" and "Friday" 
- **Unspecified museums**: "two museums" per day with no specific recommendations
- **Generic flight request**: No specific airports or airlines mentioned
- **Undefined hotel criteria**: No location, price range, or specific preferences
- **General weather inquiry**: No specific dates or forecast details
- **YouTube request**: No specific museums to search for

## Refinement Strategy

### 1. Date Concretization
**Problem**: Relative dates ("Tuesday of the next week", "Friday")
**Solution**: 
- Current date: August 29, 2025 (Friday)
- "Tuesday of the next week" = September 2, 2025
- Return "Friday" = September 5, 2025
- **Reasoning**: Clear date calculation eliminates ambiguity and enables specific flight/hotel searches

### 2. Museum Recommendations
**Problem**: No specific museums mentioned
**Solution**: Use NLWeb API with natural language query
- Query: "I am traveling to Anchorage, Alaska for 3 days. Can you recommend 6 good museums to visit? I want to visit 2 museums per full day."
- **Reasoning**: Leverages AI recommendations to get relevant, specific museum suggestions for the destination

### 3. Flight Search Concretization
**Problem**: Generic "round trip flight" request
**Solution**: Use Alaska Airlines API with specific airports
- Origin: SEA (Seattle-Tacoma International)
- Destination: ANC (Ted Stevens Anchorage International)
- **Reasoning**: Alaska Airlines is a major carrier for Alaska routes; specific airport codes enable precise flight searches

### 4. Hotel Search Specification
**Problem**: Vague "list of options" request
**Solution**: Use Booking.com API with specific parameters
- Location: "Anchorage, Alaska"
- Check-in: September 2, 2025
- Check-out: September 5, 2025
- **Reasoning**: Booking.com provides comprehensive hotel options; specific dates ensure availability

### 5. Weather Forecast Targeting
**Problem**: General "weather in coming days"
**Solution**: Use OpenWeather API with geocoding
- First get Anchorage coordinates via location search
- Retrieve 5-day forecast filtering for travel dates (Sept 2-5)
- **Reasoning**: Specific date filtering provides relevant weather information for trip planning

### 6. YouTube Video Discovery
**Problem**: "Youtube video for each museum" without knowing which museums
**Solution**: Sequential approach
- Parse museum recommendations from NLWeb response
- For each museum, search YouTube with query: "{museum_name} Anchorage Alaska tour virtual visit"
- **Reasoning**: Dependency chain ensures videos match actual recommended museums

## Data Collection Strategy
All gathered information is systematically collected as JSON objects and appended to `known_facts.md` for future reference and iteration, including:
- Travel dates and duration
- Museum recommendations with source query
- Flight search results and pricing
- Hotel options with pricing
- Weather forecast for travel period
- YouTube videos for each recommended museum

## Implementation Benefits
1. **Eliminates ambiguity**: Converts all relative references to absolute values
2. **Enables automation**: Specific APIs and parameters allow programmatic execution
3. **Provides comprehensive data**: Covers all aspects mentioned in original task
4. **Supports iteration**: Collected facts enable future refinements and decision-making
5. **Maintains traceability**: Documents reasoning and sources for each piece of information

This strategy transforms a vague travel inquiry into a systematic data collection process that produces actionable travel planning information.
