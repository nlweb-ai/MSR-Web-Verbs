# Refinement Strategy for Task 0003

## Objective
Address the new requirement: "we want to see kids winter jackets in the Anchorage costco. Please get a list of the jackets."

## Areas Identified as Non-Concrete
1. **Kids Winter Jacket Selection**: The request is specific but lacks concrete product information from the Anchorage Costco location.
2. **Store Logistics**: No information about the Anchorage Costco location, hours, or accessibility during the travel dates.
3. **Weather Appropriateness**: Need to understand what type of winter clothing is actually needed for kids in Anchorage in September.
4. **Product Availability**: Unknown what specific jacket options, brands, sizes, and prices are available at the Anchorage location.

## Refinement Strategy

### Step 1: Costco Warehouse Setup
- Use `costco_com.setPreferredWarehouse("Anchorage, Alaska")` to ensure searches are specific to the Anchorage location
- This ensures product availability and pricing are accurate for the specific store they'll visit

### Step 2: Comprehensive Product Search
- Use `costco_com.searchProducts("kids winter jackets")` for the primary search
- Conduct additional searches with related terms:
  - "children winter coats"
  - "toddler winter jackets"
  - "youth winter outerwear" 
  - "kids snow jackets"
- This provides comprehensive coverage of available options across different age groups and terminology

### Step 3: Weather Context Research
- Use `NLWeb.AskNLWeb()` to get expert advice on appropriate clothing for kids in Anchorage in September
- This ensures the jacket selection is appropriate for the actual weather conditions they'll encounter

### Step 4: Store Information Collection
- Use `NLWeb.AskNLWeb()` to get Anchorage Costco store details:
  - Exact address and location
  - Operating hours during their visit (September 2-5, 2025)
  - Store accessibility and visit planning information

### Step 5: Data Organization and Storage
- Collect all product information including names, prices, and availability
- Store results in structured JSON format in `known_facts.md`
- Provide comprehensive shopping list for the family's Costco visit

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Complete Product List**: Detailed inventory of kids winter jackets available at Anchorage Costco with names and prices
2. **Weather-Appropriate Guidance**: Expert recommendations on what type of winter clothing is needed for September in Anchorage
3. **Store Visit Planning**: Practical information about when and how to visit the Anchorage Costco during their trip
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple search strategies to ensure no suitable products are missed

## Implementation Details
- Uses Costco's e-commerce interface to access real inventory data
- Leverages location-specific warehouse settings for accurate availability
- Integrates weather expertise to ensure practical recommendations
- Provides multiple search approaches to capture different product categories and terminology
- Creates actionable shopping information for the family's Alaska trip

## Context Integration
This refinement addresses a practical family need during their Alaska trip, ensuring they can purchase appropriate winter clothing for children while visiting Anchorage. The timing (September) makes this particularly relevant as it's the transition into fall/winter season in Alaska.
