## Task description 

My wife and I plan to fly to Anchorage on Tuesday of the next week, and come back to Seattle on Friday. In each full day there, we want to visit two museums. Please help us concretize this travel plan by finding a round trip flight and recommending good museums.

We need to find a hotel for all nights. Please suggest a list of options. Since the museums are already selected, I want to select the hotel which has the smallest total distance to all the museums.

We would like to know the weather in Anchorage in the coming days, so that we can better prepared. Also, please find a Youtube video for each of the museums.
