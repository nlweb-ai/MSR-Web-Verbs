# Refinement Strategy for Task 0002

## Objective
Refine the hotel selection process by determining which hotel has the smallest total distance to all selected museums in Anchorage, Alaska.

## Areas Identified as Non-Concrete
1. **Hotel Selection Criteria**: The task mentions wanting "the hotel which has the smallest total distance to all the museums" but this requires concrete distance calculations.
2. **Exact Addresses**: While we have hotel and museum names, we need precise addresses for accurate distance calculations.
3. **Distance Calculations**: No actual measurements exist between the 5 hotel options and 6 museum locations.

## Refinement Strategy

### Step 1: Address Collection
- Use `NLWeb.AskNLWeb()` to obtain exact street addresses for all 6 museums
- Use `NLWeb.AskNLWeb()` to obtain exact street addresses for all 5 hotels
- This provides the precise location data needed for accurate distance calculations

### Step 2: Distance Matrix Calculation
- Use `maps_google_com.get_direction()` to calculate distance and travel time from each hotel to each museum
- Create a comprehensive distance matrix showing:
  - Distance from each hotel to each museum
  - Travel time for each route
  - Total cumulative distance from each hotel to all museums

### Step 3: Optimal Location Analysis
- Use `NLWeb.AskNLWeb()` to get expert recommendations on the best central location in Anchorage for visiting these specific museums
- This provides additional context beyond just raw distance calculations

### Step 4: Data Collection and Storage
- Collect all distance calculations as structured JSON data
- Store results in `known_facts.md` for future reference
- Provide clear comparison data to help with hotel selection decision

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Concrete Data**: Exact distances and travel times between all hotel-museum pairs
2. **Clear Comparison**: Total distance calculations for each hotel option
3. **Expert Insight**: Professional recommendations for optimal hotel location
4. **Decision Support**: All data needed to make an informed hotel selection based on proximity to museums
