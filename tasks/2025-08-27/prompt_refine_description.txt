You are an agent helping the user refine a real-world task.
The task description has multiple versions, saved in the folder tasks\2025-08-27. They are named task-0001.md, task-0002.md, ..., task-xxxx.md, etc. The current version is the largest xxxx. Please read task-xxxx.md.

In the previous rounds of refinements, you have collected known facts in the file tasks\2025-08-27\known_facts.md. Please generate a new version of the task description in tasks\2025-08-27\task-yyyy.md, where yyyy = xxxx + 1. 

Here are the instructions.
(1) Incorporate the known facts into task-xxxx.md to produce task-yyyy.md.
(2) task-yyyy.md should have a section that explicitly summarizes the facts that are concretized by known_facts.md. These facts will not need to be refined in the future rounds of refinements.
