# Refinement Strategy for Task 0004

## Objective
Address the new requirements: "Finally, please create a google maps list named 'Anchorage 2025' (if there is an existing list with the same name, please delete it first). Please add the anchorage airport, the selected hotel and the museums into this list. When it is done, compose a nicely-formatted itinerary and send it to johndoe@contoso.com using Microsoft Teams."

## Areas Identified as Non-Concrete
1. **Trip Organization**: Need a centralized way to organize all trip locations for easy navigation
2. **Itinerary Communication**: Need to share the complete trip plan with others in a formatted, professional manner
3. **Location Management**: All key locations need to be accessible in a single, organized list
4. **Trip Documentation**: Final trip details need to be properly documented and shared

## Refinement Strategy

### Step 1: Google Maps List Cleanup
- Use `maps_google_com.deleteList("Anchorage 2025")` to remove any existing list with the same name
- This ensures a clean slate for creating the new, current trip list
- Prevents confusion from outdated or duplicate lists

### Step 2: Comprehensive Location List Creation
- Use `maps_google_com.createList("Anchorage 2025", places)` to create a new organized list
- Include all essential trip locations:
  - Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (arrival/departure point)
  - The Wildbirch Hotel - JdV by Hyatt (selected accommodation)
  - All 6 museums (Anchorage Museum, Alaska Native Heritage Center, Alaska Aviation Museum, Alaska Zoo, Alaska Veterans Museum, Oscar Anderson House Museum)
- This provides one-stop navigation for the entire trip

### Step 3: Professional Itinerary Composition
Create a comprehensive, well-formatted itinerary including:
- **Trip Overview**: Dates, duration, basic logistics
- **Flight Details**: Specific flight numbers, times, costs
- **Accommodation**: Hotel details, location advantages, pricing
- **Daily Museum Schedule**: Optimized routing based on distance analysis
- **Shopping Information**: Costco jacket options and recommendations
- **Cost Summary**: Complete financial breakdown
- **Trip Highlights**: Key advantages of the planned approach
- Use emojis and clear formatting for readability

### Step 4: Microsoft Teams Communication
- Use `teams_microsoft_com.sendMessage("johndoe@contoso.com", itinerary)` to share the complete itinerary
- Professional communication method suitable for sharing detailed travel plans
- Ensures the recipient has all necessary trip information in one message

### Step 5: Documentation and Tracking
- Record all actions taken (list deletion, creation, messaging)
- Track success/failure of each operation
- Store results in `known_facts.md` for reference
- Provide confirmation of completed organizational tasks

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Organized Navigation**: Google Maps list with all trip locations for easy access during travel
2. **Professional Communication**: Complete itinerary shared via Teams with recipient
3. **Trip Documentation**: All organizational actions recorded and confirmed
4. **Practical Travel Tool**: Ready-to-use navigation list accessible from any device with Google Maps
