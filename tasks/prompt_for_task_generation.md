### Prompt for generating tasks:

Read the *.itfc files in #file:interfaces, choose 4 unique functions from them, and make up a simple task descriptions that the task can be done by calling the 4 functions. 
The output folder is tasks\2025-08-01. For better diversity, please read the existing files in the output folder, and try to come up with a task different from existing ones.
Using first person perspective "I". Please feel free to mention company names such as Costco, Redfin, etc. 
If there are dates in the task description, please pick dates that are within the next 30 days (unless the function signature imposes a different criterion). The task should be explicit about dates, cities, etc. 
To make the task more non-trivial, please think of meaningful local computations to add between the function calls.
Please write the task description to a file task-*.txt, where * stands for a 4 digits case-number.
The first case-number is 0101. Generate 10 cases in total in the output folder.
