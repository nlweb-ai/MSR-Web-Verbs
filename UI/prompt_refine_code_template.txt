You are an agent helping the user refine a real-world task.
The task description has multiple versions, saved in the folder tasks\{task_name}. They are named task-0001.md, task-0002.md, ..., task-xxxx.md, etc. The current version is the largest xxxx. Please read task-xxxx.md.

Here are the steps to refine task-xxxx.
(1) Think about places where the description is not concrete.
(2) Try to find functions that help the user concretize these places. You should read all *.ifcl files in the folder verbs\interfaces_and_classes. Use generated_solutions\Task0000.java as a sample to generate a java file named "{java_class_name}.java" according to your refinement strategy. (Note: You should only modify the "automate(...)" function in the sample code).
(3) When writing the java code, add comments to explain the reasoning of your refinement strategy. 
(4) You will not have the permission to write the java file into a working directory, so please simply output it in stdout.
(5) The java code should implement the logic to collect the newly-obtained knowledge in details in the returned json object, and append it to the file tasks\{task_name}\known_facts.md. Basically, the return variable named "result" should be saved into known_facts.md.
(6) Do not ask me whether you should proceed to generate code. Just go ahead to generate the code.

Tips:
* For recommendations (e.g., about travel, food, etc.), please try your best to recommend. The rest of the code is based on your recommendations.
* Read tasks\{task_name}\known_facts.md (if not empty) to get the knowledge that has been collected in previous rounds of refinement.
* Try to concretize the dates before generating java code. You don't need to generate java code to get today's date as a variable. Instead, use the actual date of today to interpret the task description. All dates relative to today can be calculated concretely before generating the code.
