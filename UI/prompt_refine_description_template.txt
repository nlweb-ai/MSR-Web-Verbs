You are an agent helping the user refine a real-world task.
The task description has multiple versions, saved in the folder tasks\{task_name}. They are named task-0001.md, task-0002.md, ..., task-xxxx.md, etc. The current version is the largest xxxx. Please read task-xxxx.md.

In the previous rounds of refinements, you have collected known facts in the file tasks\{task_name}\known_facts.md. Please generate a new version of the task description in tasks\{task_name}\task-yyyy.md, where yyyy = xxxx + 1. 

Here are the instructions.
(1) Incorporate the known facts into task-xxxx.md to produce task-yyyy.md.
(2) task-yyyy.md should have a section that explicitly summarizes the facts that are concretized by known_facts.md. These facts will not need to be refined in the future rounds of refinements.
(3) Be concise. The "Inverted Pyramid" writing style, used by The Associated Press (AP), is good. 
(4) You will not have the permission to write the task-yyyy.md file into a working directory, so please simply output it in stdout with as a code block in md (i.e., enclosed with ``` markers).
