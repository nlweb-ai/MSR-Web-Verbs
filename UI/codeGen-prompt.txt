I want to write a python app that has the following UI features.
* The window is divided into 60% (left pane) and 40% (right pane).
* The left pane is divided into upper-left pane (50%) and lower-left pane(50%).
* The right pane is a chat window. It has an input box at the bottom and a submit button. Once the submit button is pressed, the input text is displayed (i.e., appended) in the current text in the right pane.

=== The above is Done. Let's continue the project.=========
Please make the upper-left pane is text editor with multi-tabs. Each tab loads a file in tasks\2025-08-27.

I want the upper-left pane to indicate the word "Tasks" somewhere, and the lower-left pane to indicate the word "Strategies" similarly. Then, the upper-left pane loads only files named "task-*.md" and the upper-left pane loads only files named "strategy-*.md".

The name of each tab for "task-*.md" should be "V*", such as "V0001". Do the same for each tab for "strategy-*.md".
